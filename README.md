## Summary
* Used Javascript to:
  - Ask which criteria to follow
  - Create a function to generate a password
  - Define the characters that can be used in arrays
  - Determine the character pool based on the criteria chosen by the user
  - Loop pushing characters to a new array, choosing from the character pool
  - Create a function to check the password
  - Use if statements with for statements to check if each criteria is met for the newly generated array
  - If one of the criteria that needs to be met is not met, rerun the generate password function
  - Once everything has been met, convert the array into a string using .join("")
  - Assign this string to password so that it will output into the HTML file
